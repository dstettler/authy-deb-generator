# authy-deb-generator

Generates a .deb file from the current snap version of Authy.

Based on the AUR PKGBUILD with the same purpose.

I'll try to keep this repo up to date but it's really only for personal purposes.
If an update comes out and I don't see it please make a PR and I should accept as soon as I see the email.

### NOTE
This requires the following commands to be able to run: `unsquashfs`, `sha256sum`, `wget`, and `dpkg-deb`.

Also - this was designed to run on distros based on Ubuntu, so it may or may not work on stock Debian, modify the dependencies in `DEBIAN/control` as you need to make it work.

Please make sure you can run these before running the script.

I've tested this on the following distros:
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Debian 10 (buster) on ChromeOS x86_64
- Pop!\_OS 21.04

## `apt update` Hook
Should you choose to install the `apt update` hook, `hook-stuff/install-hook.sh` will handle all installation and uninstallation. Make sure you ***do not*** move or remove the `authy-deb-generator` repository without first uninstalling the hook, as this could (and will) leave files stranded in your `apt.conf.d` and `/opt` folders.

Installing and uninstalling take less than a second and if you have to dig around that's on you.
